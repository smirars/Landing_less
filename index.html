                At Our Place, we believe in the power
                of home-cooking to bring people together. 
                Our collections are new heirlooms from the
                cultures and places that make up the fabric 
                of the modern multi-ethnic kitchen. 
                We design thoughtfully, source ethically, 
                and produce sustainably because what we make 
                is connected to one another and the earth we share.

    From curated essentials to limited-run editions.
    We make products inspired by traditions â€“ and we're starting with one you might be familiar with: Dinner.
    Thoughtfully designed to be the perfect size and shape to do the work of eight pieces of traditional cookware.
    Hand-painted porcelain plates, stackable and designed for big appetites.
    Hand-made and stackable. Made from recycled glass and natural sand. Naturally colored, without dyes.
    Hand-painted porcelain stackable bowls, designed for plating, eating, and scooping.
    A full sink is a sign of a great night. You wash, we'll dry.
